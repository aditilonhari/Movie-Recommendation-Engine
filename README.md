PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
In this project, I worked with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. This program was answered questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, the program is able to:

 1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
 2. Calculate average ratings;
 3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
 4. Make movie recommendations for a type of movie or for a given user based on ratings.
